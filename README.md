Introduction

This project implements various deep learning layers from scratch using Python. The purpose of this project is to provide insight into the inner workings of deep learning layers and enhance understanding of their functionality.
Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
    Navigate to the project directory: cd your_project
    Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To use the implemented deep learning layers, follow these guidelines:

    Import the desired layer classes from the corresponding Python files.
    Instantiate the layers and use them within your neural network architecture.
    Refer to the examples provided in the examples directory for usage demonstrations.

Implemented Deep Learning Layers

This project includes the following deep learning layers:

    Dense Layer: Implements a fully connected layer with customizable activation function.
    Convolutional Layer: Implements a convolutional layer with customizable kernel size, padding, and stride.
    Pooling Layer: Implements pooling operations such as max pooling or average pooling.
    Activation Layer: Implements various activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.

Testing

To run unit tests for different parts of the code, execute the following command:

pytest

Ensure that all tests pass before using the implemented layers in your projects.
Results

The implemented deep learning layers have been tested and validated using unit tests. Performance metrics and benchmarks are available in the results directory.
